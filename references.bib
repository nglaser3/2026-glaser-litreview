It provides a brief theoretical overview of the {CADIS}-{DXTRAN} method and describes the coding process in {NECP}-{MCX}. The study compares the performance of the {CADIS}-{DXTRAN} method with the {CADIS} method and the {DXTRAN} method in a labyrinth problem and a channel shielding problem. The results of the labyrinth problem reveal that the {CADIS}-{DXTRAN} method is highly efficient with a Figure of Merit ({FOM}) value 45 times that of {DXTRAN} and 17 times that of the {CADIS} method. While there is no significant improvement of the {CADIS}-{DXTRAN} method in the channel shielding problem. The particle behavior in the two problems is analyzed in detail to explain the performance of the {CADIS}-{DXTRAN} method.},

	abstract = {Shutdown dose rate ({SDDR}) analysis requires (a) a neutron transport calculation to estimate neutron flux fields, (b) an activation calculation to compute radionuclide inventories and associated photon sources, and (c) a photon transport calculation to estimate final {SDDR}. In some applications, accurate full-scale Monte Carlo ({MC}) {SDDR} simulations are needed for very large systems with massive amounts of shielding materials. However, these simulations are impractical because calculation of space- and energy-dependent neutron fluxes throughout the structural materials is needed to estimate distribution of radioisotopes causing the {SDDR}. Biasing the neutron {MC} calculation using an importance function is not simple because it is difficult to explicitly express the response function, which depends on subsequent computational steps. Typical {SDDR} calculations do not consider how uncertainties in {MC} neutron calculation impact {SDDR} uncertainty, even though {MC} neutron calculation uncertainties usually dominate {SDDR} uncertainty. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling ({MS}-{CADIS}) hybrid {MC}/deterministic method was developed to speed {SDDR} {MC} neutron transport calculation using a deterministically calculated importance function representing the neutron importance to the final {SDDR}. Undersampling is usually inevitable in large-problem {SDDR} simulations because it is very difficult for the {MC} method to simulate particles in all space and energy elements of the neutron calculation. {MS}-{CADIS} can assess the degree of undersampling in {SDDR} calculations by determining the fraction of the {SDDR} response in the space and energy elements that did not have any scores in the {MC} neutron calculation. It can also provide estimates for upper and lower limits of {SDDR} statistical uncertainties resulting from uncertainties in {MC} neutron calculation. {MS}-{CADIS} was applied to the {ITER} {SDDR} benchmark problem that resembles the configuration and geometrical arrangement of an upper port plug in {ITER}. Without using the hybrid {MC}/deterministic methods to speed {MC} neutron calculations, {SDDR} calculations were significantly undersampled for all tallies, even when {MC} neutron calculation computational time was 32 {CPU}-days. However, all {SDDR} tally results with {MC} neutron calculations of only 2 {CPU}-days converged with the standard Forward-Weighted {CADIS} ({FW}-{CADIS}) method and the {MS}-{CADIS} method. Compared to the standard {FW}-{CADIS} approach, {MS}-{CADIS} decreased the undersampling in the calculated {SDDR} by factors between 0.9\% and 0.3\% for computational times between 4 and 32 {CPU}-days, and it increased the computational efficiency of the {SDDR} neutron {MC} calculation by factors between 43\% and 69\%.},

	abstract = {Methods for deep-penetration radiation transport remain important for radiation shielding, nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and medical applications. As these applications become more ubiquitous, the need for accurate and reliable transport methods appropriate for these systems persists. For such systems, hybrid methods often obtain reliable answers in the shortest time by leveraging the speed and uniform uncertainty distribution of a deterministic solution to bias Monte Carlo transport and reduce the variance in the solution. This work reviews the state of the art among such hybrid methods. First, we summarize variance reduction ({VR}) for Monte Carlo radiation transport and existing efforts to automate these techniques. Relations among {VR}, importance, and the adjoint solution of the neutron transport equation are then discussed. Based on this exposition, the work transitions from theory to a critical review of existing {VR} implementations in modern nuclear engineering software. At present, the Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling ({CADIS}) and Forward-Weighted Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling ({FW}-{CADIS}) hybrid methods are the gold standard by which to reduce the variance in problems that have deeply penetrating radiation. The {CADIS} and {FW}-{CADIS} methods use an adjoint scalar flux to generate {VR} parameters for Monte Carlo radiation transport. Additionally, efforts to incorporate angular information into {VR} methods for Monte Carlo are summarized. Finally, we assess various implementations of these methods and the degree to which they improve {VR} for their target applications.},

	abstract = {The rigorous 2-step (R2S) computational system uses three-dimensional Monte Carlo transport simulations to calculate the shutdown dose rate ({SDDR}) in fusion reactors. Accurate full-scale R2S calculations are impractical in fusion reactors because they require calculating space- and energy-dependent neutron fluxes everywhere inside the reactor. The use of global Monte Carlo variance reduction techniques was suggested for accelerating the R2S neutron transport calculation. However, the prohibitive computational costs of these approaches, which increase with the problem size and amount of shielding materials, inhibit their ability to accurately predict the {SDDR} in fusion energy systems using full-scale modeling of an entire fusion plant. This paper describes a novel hybrid Monte Carlo/deterministic methodology that uses the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling ({CADIS}) method but focuses on multi-step shielding calculations. The Multi-Step {CADIS} ({MS}-{CADIS}) methodology speeds up the R2S neutron Monte Carlo calculation using an importance function that represents the neutron importance to the final {SDDR}. Using a simplified example, preliminary results showed that the use of {MS}-{CADIS} enhanced the efficiency of the neutron Monte Carlo simulation of an {SDDR} calculation by a factor of 550 compared to standard global variance reduction techniques, and that the efficiency enhancement compared to analog Monte Carlo is higher than a factor of 10,000.},

	abstract = {{RÃSUMÃ}: Pour toute Planification de Traitement par RadiothÃ©rapie ({PTR}), il est essentiel dâavoir des outils pour calculer rapidement et avec exactitude les profils de dose. Bien que les solveurs de transport de rayonnement de Monte Carlo aient traditionnellement Ã©tÃ© considÃ©rÃ©s comme la rÃ©fÃ©rence en {PTR}, leur application dans les environnements cliniques est limitÃ©e en raison de leur temps dâexÃ©cution excessifs et de leur nature stochastique. Pourtant, il existe une multitude de mÃ©thodes dites dÃ©terministes capables de simuler lâensemble des interactions physiques avec une tout aussi grande exactitude. Le solveur AcurosÂ®, le code de Varian Medical Systems qui utilise des mÃ©thodes dÃ©terministes, est dÃ©jÃ  utilisÃ© pour les faisceaux de rayons X dans les systÃ¨mes de {PTR}. MalgrÃ© certaines avancÃ©es dans les capacitÃ©s dÃ©terministes, telles que la dÃ©rivation de lâÃ©quation de Boltzmann Fokker-Planck ({BFP}) ou le dÃ©veloppement du code {CEPXS}, les modÃ¨les dÃ©terministes existants pour la {PTR} prÃ©sentent des limitations qui entravent leur utilisation gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©e et sans contrainte Ã  tout faisceau de photons et dâÃ©lectrons. Lâobjectif principal de cette thÃ¨se est dâexaminer et de proposer des solutions Ã  ces lacunes. LâÃ©quation de Boltzmann Fokker-Planck ({BFP}) est au coeur de cette dissertation, car tous les dÃ©veloppements algorithmiques quâelle prÃ©sente sâarticulent autour de cette Ã©quation. Des lacunes ont Ã©tÃ© identifiÃ©es et dâinnovants algorithmes ont Ã©tÃ© proposÃ©s dans trois axes de recherche, soit 1) la production de donnÃ©es atomiques couplÃ©es pour les photons, les Ã©lectrons et les positrons, 2) la discrÃ©tisation angulaire de lâÃ©quation de {BFP} et 3) les relations de fermeture associÃ©es aux mÃ©thodes de Galerkin.  {ABSTRACT}: An essential requirement of Radiation Treatment Planning ({RTP}) is efficient and accurate dose deposition estimation capacities. While Monte Carlo radiation transport solvers have traditionally been considered the gold standard for {RTP}, their application in clinical environ-ments is limited due to their significant execution time and stochastic nature. Yet, a broad family of algorithms can simulate the physics of radiation therapy with similar accuracy called deterministic methods. The solver AcurosÂ®, from Varian Medical Systems, is one of them and is already used for X-ray beams in {RTP} systems. Despite breakthroughs in deter-ministic capacities, such as the derivation of the Boltzmann Fokker-Planck ({BFP}) equation or the development of {CEPXS} code, existing {RTP} deterministic models have limitations that hinder their widespread use. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and address these shortcomings. The Boltzmann Fokker-Planck ({BFP}) equation is central to this dissertation since every development in this work revolves around it. The investigations have led to innovative al-gorithms in three areas of research: 1) the production of coupled photon-electron-positron atomic data, 2) the angular discretization, and 3) the energy-space closure relations.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/992108},
	abstract = {This paper provides a review of the hybrid (Monte Carlo/deterministic) radiation transport methods and codes used at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and examples of their application for increasing the efficiency of real-world, fixed-source Monte Carlo analyses. The two principal hybrid methods are (1) Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling ({CADIS}) for optimization of a localized detector (tally) region (e.g., flux, dose, or reaction rate at a particular location) and (2) Forward Weighted {CADIS} ({FW}-{CADIS}) for optimizing distributions (e.g., mesh tallies over all or part of the problem space) or multiple localized detector regions (e.g., simultaneous optimization of two or more localized tally regions). The two methods have been implemented and automated in both the {MAVRIC} sequence of {SCALE} 6 and {ADVANTG}, a code that works with the {MCNP} code. As implemented, the methods utilize the results of approximate, fast-running 3-D discrete ordinates transport calculations (with the Denovo code) to generate consistent space- and energy-dependent source and transport (weight windows) biasing parameters. These methods and codes have been applied to many relevant and challenging problems, including calculations of {PWR} ex-core thermal detector response, dose rates throughout an entire {PWR} facility, site boundary dose from arrays of commercial spent fuel storage casks, radiation fields for criticality accident alarm system placement, and detector response for special nuclear material detection scenarios and nuclear well-logging tools. Substantial computational speed-ups, generally O(10\{2-4\}), have been realized for all applications to date. This paper provides a brief review of the methods, their implementation, results of their application, and current development activities, as well as a considerable list of references for readers seeking more information about the methods and/or their applications.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the developments in perturbation theory. Perturbation theory and techniques are coming of age. They provide increasing support for the design and analysis of nuclear systems, and the evaluation of nuclear data. This is evidenced by the large number of perturbation-theory-based computer codes developed. These trends characterize the new codes: (1) the extension of conventional perturbation techniques to multidimensional systems and to high-order approximations of the Boltzmann equation; (2) the development of methods for implementing new perturbation theory formulations such as the generalized perturbation theory formulations; and (3) the application of perturbation theory formulations to new fields such as sensitivity studies and the solution of deep-penetration problems. Despite the significant progress made in perturbation theory since 1968, additional development is necessary before perturbation-based methods become reliable standard tools for the nuclear engineer. These developments can be grouped into four categories: (1) resolution of fundamental questions, (2) development of formulations for new applications, (3) acquisition of practical experience on the range of applicability and relative merits of alternative perturbation theory formulations, and (4) development of computer code systems.},

It is based on the behavior of a pseudo particle called a ``contributon,`` which is the response carrier through space and energy channels that connect the source and detector. ``Contributons`` are those particles among all the ones contained in the system which will eventually contribute some amount of response to the detector. The specific goals of this projects are to provide a more fundamental theoretical understanding of the method, and to develop computer programs to apply the techniques to practical problems encountered in radiation transport analysis. The overall project can be divided into three components to meet these objectives: (a) Theoretical Development, (b) Code Development, and (c) Sample Applications. During the present third year of this study, an application of contributon theory to the analysis of radiation heating in a nuclear rocket has been completed, and a paper on the assessment of radiation damage response of an {LWR} pressure vessel and analysis of radiation propagation through space and energy channels in air at the Hiroshima weapon burst was accepted for publication. A major effort was devoted to developing a new ``Contributon Monte Carlo`` method, which can improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo calculations of radiation transport by tracking only contributons. The theoretical basis for Contributon Monte Carlo has been completed, and the implementation and testing of the technique is presently being performed.},

	abstract = {It is known that a priori information on the distribution of neutron ï¬uxes over neutron transport models can improve the computational eï¬ciency of Monte Carlo transport calculations via the use of variance reduction techniques. The uncertainty lies in ï¬nding a method which obtains this information as fast and eï¬ortlessly as possible. A number of global variance reduction techniques were tested on the {ITER} reference neutronics model for their applicability for performing large three-dimensional transport simulations for {ITER}. Among these, we propose a new method which is computationally fast and eï¬cient in determining the a priori ï¬ux information. The new method, known as {MAGIC} (Method of Automatic Generation of Importances by Calculation), was found to perform well. The {MAGIC} method uses an initial analogue run to determine an approximate distribution of particle ï¬ux across as much of the problem as possible. The output of this run is then used to produce an {MCNP} weight window ï¬le and used as the input for a subsequent calculation. This iterative stage proceeds until the entire mesh is populated. The {MAGIC} method was applied to the {ITER} Tritium Breeding System ({TBS}) model, which has an extent of over 20 metres, and used to produce a mesh weight window ï¬le for {MCNP}. The weight window was capable of providing high resolution neutron spectra over the entire model domain.},

	title = {An enhanced geometry-independent mesh weight window generator for {MCNP}},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/663177},
	abstract = {A new, enhanced, weight window generator suite has been developed for {MCNP}\{trademark\}. The new generator correctly estimates importances in either an user-specified, geometry-independent orthogonal grid or in {MCNP} geometric cells. The geometry-independent option alleviates the need to subdivide the {MCNP} cell geometry for variance reduction purposes. In addition, the new suite corrects several pathologies in the existing {MCNP} weight window generator. To verify the correctness of the new implementation, comparisons are performed with the analytical solution for the cell importance. Using the new generator, differences between Monte Carlo generated and analytical importances are less than 0.1\%. Also, assumptions implicit in the original {MCNP} generator are shown to be poor in problems with high scattering media. The new generator is fully compatible with {MCNP}`s {AVATAR}\{trademark\} automatic variance reduction method. The new generator applications, together with {AVATAR}, gives {MCNP} an enhanced suite of variance reduction methods. The flexibility and efficacy of this suite is demonstrated in a neutron porosity tool well-logging problem.},

The deterministic calculations can be performed using multiple cores and/or processors (e.g., on multi-core desktop systems and clusters). The final variance reduction parameters are output in a format that can be used with unmodified versions of {MCNP}. The primary objective of the development of {ADVANTG} has been to reduce both the user effort and the computational time required to obtain accurate and precise tally estimates across a broad range of challenging transport application areas.},

This paper presents an exposition of the most useful methods of variance reduction. The exposition is unified by consistent exploitation of adjoint formulations to estimate expected values, as in previous work, and further to evaluate the variance of the resulting estimates., The connection between adjoint formulations and the choice of biasing schemes is also investigated. In particular, it is shown that the value function (the solution of the integral equation of the adjoint formulation) is always a good choice for importance function biasing; a sharp upper bound, independent of the particular problem, is found for the resulting variance. Predicted (analytic) and experimental (Monte Carlo) results are also given for a simple one-dimensional problem.},

	title = {A ``local`` exponential transform method for global variance reduction in Monte Carlo transport problems},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/10167411},
	abstract = {Numerous variance reduction techniques, such as splitting/Russian roulette, weight windows, and the exponential transform exist for improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo transport calculations. Typically, however, these methods, while reducing the variance in the problem area of interest tend to increase the variance in other, presumably less important, regions. As such, these methods tend to be not as effective in Monte Carlo calculations which require the minimization of the variance everywhere. Recently, ``Local`` Exponential Transform ({LET}) methods have been developed as a means of approximating the zero-variance solution. A numerical solution to the adjoint diffusion equation is used, along with an exponential representation of the adjoint flux in each cell, to determine ``local`` biasing parameters. These parameters are then used to bias the forward Monte Carlo transport calculation in a manner similar to the conventional exponential transform, but such that the transform parameters are now local in space and energy, not global. Results have shown that the Local Exponential Transform often offers a significant improvement over conventional geometry splitting/Russian roulette with weight windows. Since the biasing parameters for the Local Exponential Transform were determined from a low-order solution to the adjoint transport problem, the {LET} has been applied in problems where it was desirable to minimize the variance in a detector region. The purpose of this paper is to show that by basing the {LET} method upon a low-order solution to the forward transport problem, one can instead obtain biasing parameters which will minimize the maximum variance in a Monte Carlo transport calculation.},
