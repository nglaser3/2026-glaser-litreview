	abstract = {Radiative transfer is a notoriously difficult and computationally demanding problem. Yet, it is an indispensable ingredient in nearly all astrophysical and cosmological simulations. Choosing an appropriate discretization scheme is a crucial part of the simulation, since it not only determines the direct memory cost of the model but also largely determines the computational cost and the achievable accuracy. In this paper, we show how an appropriate choice of directional discretization scheme as well as spatial model mesh can help alleviate the computational cost, while largely retaining the accuracy. First, we discuss the adaptive ray-tracing scheme implemented in our 3D radiative transfer library magritte, that adapts the rays to the spatial mesh and uses a hierarchical directional discretization based on healpix. Second, we demonstrate how the free and open-source software library gmsh can be used to generate high-quality meshes that can be easily tailored for magritte. In particular, we show how the local element size distribution of the mesh can be used to optimize the sampling of both analytically and numerically defined models. Furthermore, we show that when using the output of hydrodynamics simulations as input for a radiative transfer simulation, the number of elements in the input model can often be reduced by an order of magnitude, without significant loss of accuracy in the radiation field. We demonstrate this for two models based on a hierarchical octree mesh resulting from adaptive mesh refinement, as well as two models based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics data.},

	abstract = {Non-LTE radiative transfer is a key tool for modern astrophysics: it is the means by which many key synthetic observables are produced, thus connecting simulations and observations. The default approach for computing the radiation field in multidimensional solar radiative transfer models has long remained the same: a short characteristics, discrete ordinates method, formal solver. In situations with complex atmospheric structure and multiple transitions between optically thick and thin regimes these solvers require prohibitively high angular resolution to correctly resolve the radiation field. Here, we present the theory of radiance cascades, a technique designed to exploit structure inherent to the radiation field, allowing for efficient reuse of calculated samples, thus providing a very high-resolution result at a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods. We additionally describe our implementation of this method in the DexRT code, and present initial results of the synthesis of a snapshot of a magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar prominence formed via levitation-condensation, along with comparison against short characteristics solutions. The approach presented here provides a credible route for routinely performing multidimensional radiative transfer calculations free from so-called ray effects, and scaling high-quality non-LTE models to next-generation high-performance computing systems with GPU accelerators.},

	abstract = {RÉSUMÉ: Pour toute Planification de Traitement par Radiothérapie (PTR), il est essentiel d’avoir des outils pour calculer rapidement et avec exactitude les profils de dose. Bien que les solveurs de transport de rayonnement de Monte Carlo aient traditionnellement été considérés comme la référence en PTR, leur application dans les environnements cliniques est limitée en raison de leur temps d’exécution excessifs et de leur nature stochastique. Pourtant, il existe une multitude de méthodes dites déterministes capables de simuler l’ensemble des interactions physiques avec une tout aussi grande exactitude. Le solveur Acuros®, le code de Varian Medical Systems qui utilise des méthodes déterministes, est déjà utilisé pour les faisceaux de rayons X dans les systèmes de PTR. Malgré certaines avancées dans les capacités déterministes, telles que la dérivation de l’équation de Boltzmann Fokker-Planck (BFP) ou le développement du code CEPXS, les modèles déterministes existants pour la PTR présentent des limitations qui entravent leur utilisation généralisée et sans contrainte à tout faisceau de photons et d’électrons. L’objectif principal de cette thèse est d’examiner et de proposer des solutions à ces lacunes. L’équation de Boltzmann Fokker-Planck (BFP) est au coeur de cette dissertation, car tous les développements algorithmiques qu’elle présente s’articulent autour de cette équation. Des lacunes ont été identifiées et d’innovants algorithmes ont été proposés dans trois axes de recherche, soit 1) la production de données atomiques couplées pour les photons, les électrons et les positrons, 2) la discrétisation angulaire de l’équation de BFP et 3) les relations de fermeture associées aux méthodes de Galerkin.  ABSTRACT: An essential requirement of Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP) is efficient and accurate dose deposition estimation capacities. While Monte Carlo radiation transport solvers have traditionally been considered the gold standard for RTP, their application in clinical environ-ments is limited due to their significant execution time and stochastic nature. Yet, a broad family of algorithms can simulate the physics of radiation therapy with similar accuracy called deterministic methods. The solver Acuros®, from Varian Medical Systems, is one of them and is already used for X-ray beams in RTP systems. Despite breakthroughs in deter-ministic capacities, such as the derivation of the Boltzmann Fokker-Planck (BFP) equation or the development of CEPXS code, existing RTP deterministic models have limitations that hinder their widespread use. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and address these shortcomings. The Boltzmann Fokker-Planck (BFP) equation is central to this dissertation since every development in this work revolves around it. The investigations have led to innovative al-gorithms in three areas of research: 1) the production of coupled photon-electron-positron atomic data, 2) the angular discretization, and 3) the energy-space closure relations.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Accurate radiotherapy dose calculation algorithms are essential to any successful radiotherapy program, considering the high level of dose conformity and modulation in many of today's treatment plans. As technology continues to progress, such as is the case with novel MRI-guided radiotherapy systems, the necessity for dose calculation algorithms to accurately predict delivered dose in increasingly challenging scenarios is vital. To this end, a novel deterministic solution has been developed to the first order linear Boltzmann transport equation which accurately calculates x-ray based radiotherapy doses in the presence of magnetic fields. Methods: The deterministic formalism discussed here with the inclusion of magnetic fields is outlined mathematically using a discrete ordinates angular discretization in an attempt to leverage existing deterministic codes. It is compared against the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code, utilizing the emf\_macros addition which calculates the effects of electromagnetic fields. This comparison is performed in an inhomogeneous phantom that was designed to present a challenging calculation for deterministic calculations in 0, 0.6, and 3 T magnetic fields oriented parallel and perpendicular to the radiation beam. The accuracy of the formalism discussed here against Monte Carlo was evaluated with a gamma comparison using a standard 2\%/2 mm and a more stringent 1\%/1 mm criterion for a standard reference 10 × 10 cm2 field as well as a smaller 2 × 2 cm2 field. Results: Greater than 99.8\% (94.8\%) of all points analyzed passed a 2\%/2 mm (1\%/1 mm) gamma criterion for all magnetic field strengths and orientations investigated. All dosimetric changes resulting from the inclusion of magnetic fields were accurately calculated using the deterministic formalism. However, despite the algorithm's high degree of accuracy, it is noticed that this formalism was not unconditionally stable using a discrete ordinate angular discretization. Conclusions: The feasibility of including magnetic field effects in a deterministic solution to the first order linear Boltzmann transport equation is shown. The results show a high degree of accuracy when compared against Monte Carlo calculations in all magnetic field strengths and orientations tested.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiotherapy systems demands the incorporation of the magnetic field into dose calculation algorithms of treatment planning systems. This is due to the fact that the Lorentz force of the magnetic field perturbs the path of the relativistic electrons, hence altering the dose deposited by them. Building on the previous work, the authors have developed a discontinuous finite element space-angle treatment of the linear Boltzmann transport equation to accurately account for the effects of magnetic fields on radiotherapy doses. Methods: The authors present a detailed description of their new formalism and compare its accuracy to geant4 Monte Carlo calculations for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the radiation beam at field strengths of 0.5 and 3 T for an inhomogeneous 3D slab geometry phantom comprising water, bone, and air or lung. The accuracy of the authors' new formalism was determined using a gamma analysis with a 2\%/2 mm criterion. Results: Greater than 98.9\% of all points analyzed passed the 2\%/2 mm gamma criterion for the field strengths and orientations tested. The authors have benchmarked their new formalism against Monte Carlo in a challenging radiation transport problem with a high density material (bone) directly adjacent to a very low density material (dry air at STP) where the effects of the magnetic field dominate collisions. Conclusions: A discontinuous finite element space-angle approach has been proven to be an accurate method for solving the linear Boltzmann transport equation with magnetic fields for cases relevant to MRI guided radiotherapy. The authors have validated the accuracy of this novel technique against geant4, even in cases of strong magnetic field strengths and low density air.},

One of the difficulties is that the plasma of a stellar atmosphere can be highly inhomogeneous and dynamic, which implies the need to solve the non-equilibrium problem of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation in realistic three-dimensional (3D) stellar atmospheric models. Here we present PORTA, an efficient multilevel radiative transfer code we have developed for the simulation of the spectral line polarization caused by scattering processes and the Hanle and Zeeman effects in 3D models of stellar atmospheres. The numerical method of solution is based on the non-linear multigrid iterative method and on a novel short-characteristics formal solver of the Stokes-vector transfer equation which uses monotonic Bézier interpolation. Therefore, with PORTA the computing time needed to obtain at each spatial grid point the self-consistent values of the atomic density matrix (which quantifies the excitation state of the atomic system) scales linearly with the total number of grid points. Another crucial feature of PORTA is its parallelization strategy, which allows us to speed up the numerical solution of complicated 3D problems by several orders of magnitude with respect to sequential radiative transfer approaches, given its excellent linear scaling with the number of available processors. The PORTA code can also be conveniently applied to solve the simpler 3D radiative transfer problem of unpolarized radiation in multilevel systems.},

The applicability of these higher order differential operators to representative scattering kernels is discussed. It is shown that, depending upon the details of the scattering kernel in the integral operator, higher order Fokker-Planck approximations may or may not be valid. Even the classic low-order Fokker-Planck operator fails as an approximation for certain highly peaked scattering kernels. In particular, no Fokker-Planck operator is a valid approximation for scattering involving the widely used Henyey-Greenstein scattering kernel.},

	abstract = {Moment-preserving Generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) approximations for highly peaked angular scattering kernels have been previously developed and numerically demonstrated to be significantly more accurate than the Fokker-Planck (FP) approximation. Here this methodology is employed in constructing GFP approximations to highly peaked energy loss kernels relevant to fast-ion slowing down. Numerical solutions are obtained using space-energy discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and energy spectra and dose profiles for the FP and second and fourth-order GFP approximations are compared against Monte Carlo simulation of the exact problem. The fourth-order GFP approximation is seen to be extremely accurate relative to the FP approximation which moreover shows significant upscatter in energy.},

Mixed-moment minimum-entropy models are known to overcome the zero net-flux problem of full-moment minimum-entropy M𝑛 models. A realizability theory for these mixed moments of arbitrary order is derived, as well as a new closure, which we refer to as Kershaw closure. They provide nonnegative distribution functions combined with an analytical closure. Numerical tests are performed with standard first-order finite volume schemes and compared with a finite difference Fokker--Planck scheme.},

	abstract = {Many astrophysical problems require a knowledge of the spatial and temporal evolution of fast electron distributions as they interact (e.g., collisionally) with an ambient medium; an example is provided by hard X-ray burst modelling in solar flares. In the mean scattering-rate approximation (which neglects dispersion in the distribution function), this evolution is governed by the continuity equation in phase space. Here we present a rigorous solution of the continuity equation, derived via the method of characteristics, which confirms and generalises the results of previous authors, and gives greater physical and mathematical insight into these solutions. We illustrate the calculation of this solution for mildly relativistic electrons undergoing Coulomb collisions, and briefly indicate the extension of the method to other physical situations.},

At that time, SN methodology existed primarily for reactor physics simulations. By today’s standards, those capabilities were limited, due to the less-developed theoretical state of SN methods and the slower and smaller computers that were then available. In this chapter, we review some of the major advances in SN methodology that have occurred since 1968. These advances, combined with the faster speeds and larger memories of today’s computers, enable today’s SN codes to simulate problems of much greater complexity, realism, and physical variety. Since 1968, several books and reviews on general numerical methods for SN simulations have been published [32, 46, 71], but none of these covers the advanced work done during the past 20 years.},

Only one-dimensional slab geometry is considered in this study, but it appears that this method can be generalized to curvilinear and multidimensional geometries. The new method is derived, theoretically analyzed, and computationally tested. The angular multigrid method costs only about twice as much as the DSA method, but it gives a spectral radius of 0.6 in the asymptotic forward-peaked Fokker-Planck scattering limit, whereas the diffusion synthetic method gives a spectral radius of unity.},
